# Contributing To Smart Island

Thanks for helping make Smart Island better. This project is public, so please keep issues, pull requests, screenshots, and logs free of private notification content, secrets, keystores, tokens, and local machine paths.

## Ways To Contribute

- Report bugs with clear reproduction steps.
- Suggest focused feature ideas.
- Improve Compose UI, animations, accessibility, or Android compatibility.
- Add tests, documentation, and device-specific notes.
- Refactor carefully when it reduces real complexity.

## Development Setup

Requirements:

## Pull Request Checklist

- The app builds with the Gradle Wrapper.
- Overlay and notification-listener flows were tested when relevant.
- User-facing changes are documented in `README.md` or `CHANGELOG.md` when needed.
- No generated APKs, AABs, build folders, keystores, secrets, or personal notification screenshots are committed.
- New code follows the existing Kotlin and Compose style.
- The pull request explains the reason for the change, not only the implementation.

## Code Style

- Prefer small, focused changes over broad rewrites.
- Keep UI state explicit and lifecycle-aware.
- Use existing models and repositories before adding new abstractions.
- Add comments only for behavior that is not obvious from the code.
- Keep public documentation clear, friendly, and accurate.

## Reporting Bugs

Use the bug report issue template and include:

- Android version and device model
