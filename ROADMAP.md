# Smart Island Product Roadmap

Last updated: August 29, 2026

## Product direction

Smart Island should become the most reliable, privacy-first, and customizable glanceable activity overlay for Android. It makes important live information easier to act on without replacing the notification shade or collecting personal data.

The roadmap follows three core principles:

1. **Reliability before feature count.** Overlay, notification, media, call, timer, stopwatch, and battery behavior must remain rock-solid across Android versions and major OEM ROMs.
2. **Local by default.** Notification content, history, and preferences stay strictly on-device. Zero analytics, zero tracking, and zero cloud lock-in.
3. **Fast, fluid, and unobtrusive.** The island must use negligible battery, avoid blocking touches, and provide instant haptic and visual feedback.

## Current baseline (v6.0.0)

Smart Island currently provides:

- A Compose-based floating overlay on Android 8+ (API 26 through API 36)

### Phase 5.3 — System Profiles & Floating Window Polish (Q1 2027)

**Goal:** Provide contextual island automation and desktop-class multitasking.

- **Contextual System Profiles**:
  - *Gaming Profile*: Auto-hide all non-urgent notifications; show only low-battery alerts and high-priority callers in compact pill.
  - *Work / Focus Profile*: Prioritize calendar, live activities, and direct messaging; suppress social media alerts.
  - *Sleep / Night Profile*: Dim island brightness, disable ambient glow, and enforce silent animations.
- **Enhanced Freeform Window Docking**:
  - Preset window sizes (Quarter screen, Half screen, Pip) when triggering Swipe Down gesture.
  - Smooth animation morphing from expanded island card directly into Android Freeform window.

### Phase 6.0 — Ecosystem & Local Cross-Device Status (Q2 2027)

**Goal:** Enable modular community widgets and private multi-device glanceability.

- **Plugin Extension Architecture**:
  - Expose a secure, local IPC API for third-party Android apps to feed live activity status into Smart Island.
- **Local Cross-Device Status Sync**:
  - Peer-to-peer sync over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or local Wi-Fi to view tablet or secondary phone battery, call, or media status on your primary device.
  - Strictly zero cloud servers or remote accounts required.
